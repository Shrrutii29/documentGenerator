Factorial function : to calculate the factorial of a number.
function uses recursion to multiply the current number (n)
by the factorial of (n-1) until it reaches the base case.
Note: This function does not handle negative numbers. 

Base case: If n is 0 or 1, 'return 1', Recursion stops when n is 1 or below. 
    
Recursive case: Multiply n by factorial(n-1), recursion continues until the base case is reached. 
		
Main function to demonstrate factorial function, It takes input then calculates and prints the factorial.
 
Note: Ensure the factorial function works for all positive integers only.  
 
Avoid passing negative values as input, as it is not handled.
